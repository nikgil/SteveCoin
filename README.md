# What this project is **NOT**
Rather than explain what this project is about (and it is below), I'll start with briefly saying what it isn't.

The project is not:
- A new cryptocurrency that uses Minecraft servers for mining and promotion
- A software that uses servers as miners for a real coin

# What this project is
First and foremost it is a [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) plugin.
Secondly, it is a fun way for people to understand cryptocurrency and utilize it in an economy.
It has taken my a very long time to undersand the basics of cryptocurrency and want to try get more people
to understand through this interactive way. 
It may also fit some themes of Minecraft servers but I have never seen any crypto-themed servers.

The project as a whole is inspired from [lhartikk's NaiveCoin](https://lhartikk.github.io), and [Kass's Blockchain](https://medium.com/programmers-blockchain/create-simple-blockchain-java-tutorial-from-scratch-6eeed3cb03fa) from which I work off of.

# Why am I doing this
Primarily as a way of learning myself. I understand the very basics of crypto-trading and blockchains and feel this is a great
project to develop my knowledge further.
Also many of the accessories I use in this (Travis CI, Bintray, Codecov) are novel to me and I am learning them through this project.

What I hope to accomplish in the end is a simulator for cryptocoins, with possible (and this is far fetched) ability to convert this between servers over BungeeCord.

# Current state of plugin
Right now (version 0.0.4) the plugin possesses the bare minimum to work. It has commands to send coins, listeners for creating wallets, but no saving capability.
Currently, players can only own one wallet.
The plugin does not possess multi-world or multi-server (bungeecord) support.
